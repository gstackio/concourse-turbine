# VirtualBox CPI v0.2.2+ has set the default 'storage_controller' value to
# "sata" for virtualbox 6.1+ compatibility, but when using Bionic Stemcells
# that have been imported by VirtualBox CPI v0.2.0 or prior, there is no
# "sata" controller available, so you must use "ide".
#
# Typical error mesage at VM creation:
#   CPI 'create_vm' method responded with error:
#   ...
#   "message":"Creating VM with agent ID '{{bla-bla-bla}}': Attaching
#   ephemeral disk: Unknown controller name"
#
# When using Jammy Stemcells, it's the opposite: there is no IDE and only a
# SATA controller, so you must import them with VirtualBox 0.2.2+ with
# 'storage_controller' value set to its default, which is 'sata'.
#
# When a Stemcell is imported with the wrong 'storage_controller' setting,
# it's doomed. Bionic imported with "sata" don't find a bootable disk, and Jammy
# imported with "ide" lead to the "Unknown controller name" CPI error.
