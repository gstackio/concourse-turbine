    # NOTE: we unfortunately had to fork the BOSH Release in order to fix some
    # blocking issues with cgoups initialization in BOSH-Lite. Then the BOSH
    # Release has to be created and uploaded specifically with 'bosh
    # create-release' and 'bosh upload-release' invocations.
    #
    # Fortunately the 'pre-deploy' hook here in this Turbine subsystem will
    # automate the job for you. Be prepared to download/upload 1GB of data
    # though!
